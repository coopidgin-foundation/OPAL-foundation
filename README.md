# OPAL-foundation
A foundation for Open Planified Auxiliary Languages

Definition:

1 - The main documentation is licensed under Creative Common by-sa (or other libre license).

2 - The language has a version number, and texts indicate which version they are currently using.

3 - The language is planified, that is to say its speakers can evolve it through a kind of democracy. Any of its speakers can easily fork it to create a new language.

The easiest way I imagine for intuitive (and not boring) democracy is an endless majority judgement survey that ranks other surveys about grammar, vocabulary, organisation...

Maybe it's possible to re-use the liquid democracy tools of the Pirate Party too, but it means a lot more of training.

Well, it's just a rough draft, and I'm not fluent in English, so every suggestions are welcome.
